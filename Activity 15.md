# Part 1 Aliasing a Class
1. Create a class named foo that has a class variable notagoodidea that is initialized to "what am I now?".
2. Instantiate your class, and change the value of the instance variable notagoodidea to "who knows".
3. Instantiate your class again.
4. Print the value of the class and instance variables notagoodidea.

# Part 2 Copy a Class
5. Make a copy of the first instance of foo that you created in 2. Change the value of the instance variable notagoodidea
to "I'm lost".
6. Print out all of the instance variables, the id for the instance variables, and the id for the instances as well as the class variable. What does this tell you about mutability?
